## Why This Repository Exists

Many introductions to control systems begin with PID tuning rules without first explaining
why different controllers exist in the first place.

This repository reverses that approach:
- Start from the plant physics
- Derive the system equations
- Observe the limitations imposed by system order
- Introduce controllers only where they are justified

The emphasis is on understanding, not memorization.
