# Control Systems Playground

This repository documents my self-study and simulations in classical control
with a focus on physical intuition, modeling, and tuning.

The goal is to bridge:
- differential equations
- control algorithms
- simulation results

Topics covered:
- First-order systems and PI control
- Second-order mass–damper systems
- PD vs PID behavior
- Effect of inertia, damping, and gravity
- Tuning via pole placement

All simulations are implemented in Python using NumPy and Matplotlib.
